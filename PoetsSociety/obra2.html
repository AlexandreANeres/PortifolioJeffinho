                    <p>
                        Do not go gentle into that good night,<br>
                        Old age should burn and rave at close of day;<br>
                        Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Though wise men at their end know dark is right,<br>
                        Because their words had forked no lightning they<br>
                        Do not go gentle into that good night.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright<br>
                        Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,<br>
                        Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,<br>
                        And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,<br>
                        Do not go gentle into that good night.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight<br>
                        Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,<br>
                        Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And you, my father, there on the sad height,<br>
                        Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.<br>
                        Do not go gentle into that good night.<br>
                        Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

                <p>
                    Dylan Thomas (1914–1953) was a renowned Welsh poet and writer, known for his emotional lyricism,
                    ingenious use of language, and powerful voice in public performances. He became a legendary figure,
                    often associated with a bohemian lifestyle and excessive drinking, which contributed to his
                    premature death at age 39.
                </p>

                <h4 class="bio-topic">Major Works</h4>
                <p>Thomas is most famous for his poems and his staged "play for voices" on the radio.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>"Do not go gentle into that good night":</strong> Perhaps his best-known poem, a
                        powerful villanelle written for his dying father, urging him to fight against death.</li>
                    <li><strong>"And death shall have no dominion":</strong> Another iconic poem that explores themes of
                        mortality and resurrection.</li>
                    <li><strong>"Fern Hill":</strong> A lyrical and nostalgic poem that evokes his childhood spent in
                        rural Wales.</li>
                    <li><strong>Under Milk Wood:</strong> A critically acclaimed radio play that imaginatively and
                        humorously portrays the lives of the inhabitants of the fictional Welsh town of Llareggub.</li>
                    <li><strong>Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog:</strong> A collection of autobiographical short
                        stories.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="bio-topic">Style and Legacy</h4>
                <p>
                    His poetic style is notable for its verbal density, musical rhythm, and vivid imagery, which drew
                    upon emotions and intuitions
                    rather than contemporary social or intellectual themes, setting him apart from other poets of his
                    era like T. S. Eliot or W. H. Auden.
                    He himself helped to create his image as a "cursed, drunk, and party-going poet," who read his works
                    during acclaimed tours in the United States,
                    popularizing poetry readings as a form of performance art.
                </p>
                <p>His influence extends beyond literature:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The musician Robert Zimmerman adopted the stage name <strong>Bob Dylan</strong> in homage to the
                        Welsh poet.</li>
                    <li>Dylan Thomas is one of the figures who appears on the cover of The Beatles' album, <strong>Sgt.
                            Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</strong>.</li>
                    <li>The place where he lived in his final years, the <strong>Dylan Thomas Boathouse</strong> in
                        Laugharne, Wales, is now a museum dedicated to his life and work.</li>
                </ul>

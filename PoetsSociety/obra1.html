                    Robert Eggers is an acclaimed American filmmaker, screenwriter, and production designer,
                    known for his period films with a strong emphasis on psychological horror, folklore, and historical
                    accuracy.

                <h4 class="bio-topic">Style and Themes</h4>
                <p>
                    Eggers' films are notable for their distinct, atmospheric visual style, which often uses
                    black-and-white
                    cinematography and unusual aspect ratios to evoke a sense of vintage cinema. He is recognized for:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Historical Authenticity:</strong> Meticulous research to ensure that sets, costumes, and
                        even dialect are accurate to the period portrayed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Folklore and Mythological Themes:</strong> His narratives frequently explore the
                        conflict between rationality and the supernatural, drawing on legends and folk tales.</li>
                    <li><strong>Atmosphere and Tension:</strong> Eggers prefers to build terror and suspense through a
                        dense, uncomfortable atmosphere rather than relying on jump scares.</li>
                </ul>

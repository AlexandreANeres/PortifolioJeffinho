                    <p>
                        O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done;<br>
                        The ship has weathered every rack, the prize we sought is won;<br>
                        The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,<br>
                        While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring:<br>
                        **But O heart! heart! heart!**<br>
                        O the bleeding drops of red,<br>
                        Where on the deck my Captain lies,<br>
                        Fallen cold and dead.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;<br>
                        Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills;<br>
                        For you bouquets and ribboned wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding;<br>
                        For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;<br>
                        **Here Captain! dear father!**<br>
                        This arm beneath your head;<br>
                        It is some dream that on the deck,<br>
                        You’ve fallen cold and dead.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still;<br>
                        My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will;<br>
                        The ship is anchored safe and sound, its voyage closed and done;<br>
                        From fearful trip, the victor ship, comes in with object won;<br>
                        **Exult, O shores, and ring, O bells!**<br>
                        But I, with mournful tread,<br>
                        Walk the deck my Captain lies,<br>
                        Fallen cold and dead.

                <p>
                    Walt Whitman (1819—1892) was an American poet, essayist, and journalist. He is among the most influential 
                    poets in the American canon, often called the father of free verse. His work broke the conventions of rhyme 
                    and meter, celebrating democracy, individuality, the body, and the natural world with revolutionary openness.

                <h4 class="bio-topic">Style and Themes</h4>
                <p>
                    Whitman's magnum opus, **Leaves of Grass**, was a lifelong project first published in 1855, constantly revised 
                    and expanded until his death. His style is characterized by:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>**Free Verse:** Abandoning traditional poetic forms, he utilized natural speech rhythms, creating a vast, flowing style.</li>
                    <li>**"I" as the Nation:** His poetic persona often acted as a universal American voice, encompassing the diversity of the nation.</li>
                    <li>**Transcendentalism:** Themes of the interconnectedness of all life and the divine nature of the individual soul.</li>
                    <li>**The Civil War:** Poems like "O Captain! My Captain!" and "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd" reflect his experience as a nurse tending to wounded soldiers.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="bio-topic">Legacy</h4>
                <p>
                    The poem "O Captain! My Captain!" is an elegy dedicated to Abraham Lincoln, written shortly after his assassination. 
                    Though popular, Whitman himself regretted its popularity later in life, as it eclipsed his more experimental works. 
                    His influence extends through nearly every generation of American poets who followed him.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The poem's success led to its frequent recitation and publication in anthologies during his lifetime.</li>
                    <li>It was adapted into the climax of the film **Dead Poets Society**, emphasizing its theme of loyalty and loss.</li>
                </ul>
